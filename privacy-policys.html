<h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>

The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online- privacy-protection-act- caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p><br>

The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br>

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.<br>

<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:16px">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.

action, should a data breach occur:</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:16px">We will notify you via email<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Within 7 business days<br>
We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p><br>

<h4>CAN SPAM Act</h4>
